## Description

There's only one rule: just don't stop.

When playing, you can accelerate and decelerate using the right and left arrow keys. The faster you go, the sooner you'll run out of energy. Once that's the case, you can't control the bike anymore. If you're lucky, the bike won't lose too much speed, and you'll be able to ride a bit longer before the bike inevitably stops.

Don't land on a spike! You'll lose a lot of speed and possibly die. To avoid this, press the spacebar to jump.

When you collect enough coins, you can unlock multiple bikes with superior features. To change bikes, select the 'Change...' button. Use the arrow keys to switch bikes.

To pause, press the escape key.

## Usage

Download, import in Eclipse, run and play.
We recommend playing in fullscreen for the best experience.

When you run the program for the first time, a file ``` gamedata.txt ``` is created. This file contains your highscores, the bikes you already purchased etc.

## Sources

We did most of the programming ourselves.
